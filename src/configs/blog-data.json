    "Content": "To set up routing in a React application, use the react-router-dom library. First, install it, then wrap your app in a <Router>. Define routes with the <Route> component, specifying paths and components to display. Create separate components for each route. Use the Link component for navigation. Optionally, add a 404 Not Found route. This enables users to access different views based on the URL path and navigate between them easily.",
